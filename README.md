# FeedVote

## Problem Statement

FeedVote is a lightweight feedback and voting application for small teams and classroom projects. It simplifies idea submission, voting, and prioritization while demonstrating a complete DevOps workflow with containerization and automated CI/CD.

## System Architecture

The application uses a Streamlit frontend to collect and display feedback. The frontend sends requests to a FastAPI backend, which stores data in a SQLite database. Docker is used for containerization, GitHub Actions manages CI/CD, and Docker Hub is used for deployment.

## CI/CD Pipeline Explanation

*Backend & Frontend Tests*

The pipeline runs backend and frontend tests to validate API endpoints, database operations, and user interaction flows.

*Security Scanning*

Security scanning checks code and dependencies for vulnerabilities and exposed secrets using tools such as Bandit, Safety, and Trufflehog.

*Docker Build & Validation*

Docker build validates the backend and frontend container images and ensures the application can start successfully in the container environment.

*Integration Testing*

Integration testing uses Docker Compose to run backend, frontend, and database services together, verifying the full workflow end to end.

*Deployment*

The final stage pushes the validated Docker image to Docker Hub so the application is available for deployment.

## Git Workflow Used

The project follows a feature branch workflow. Developers create a feature branch, push changes, and open a pull request. The pull request triggers automated testing. Once tests pass, the branch is merged into main and deployment proceeds.

## Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| FastAPI | Backend API framework |
| Streamlit | Frontend user interface |
| Docker | Containerization runtime |
| Docker Compose | Local service orchestration |
| GitHub Actions | CI/CD automation |
| Docker Hub | Container image registry |
| SQLite | Lightweight relational database |

## Challenges Faced

* Docker image build and service startup issues
* CI/CD pipeline configuration and test failures
* Debugging application behavior across frontend, backend, and database
* Understanding localhost versus 0.0.0.0 for container access
* Docker Hub authentication and token management
